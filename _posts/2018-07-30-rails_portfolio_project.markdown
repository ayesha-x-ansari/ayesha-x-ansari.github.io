First major roadblock that I encounter was setting up my project, I struggled for hours trying to create a new app using “rails new” but in vain. Finally, I had to seek help from Technical support, we came to the realization that this project need to be worked on a local machine at least initially. There are bunch of steps that you have to go through to set up your local environment. Once app was created on local machine and pushed to GitHub from that points onwards I was able to work on my IDE . I love my IDE environment.

Occasionally I got stuck with my syntax or I was unable to figure out how to do certain thing. I searched Google it either lead me directly to the solution or gives hint pointing to mistake and how to fix it. 

After working with Rails, like many others I felt Rails has a very “magical” feel. In few hours you can have fully functional app up and running. Use “devise” gem and you have a fully functional user interface available with Signup, Signin, Logout screens along with field validation. But when you look under the hood you realize it’s not a “magic” it’s a lot of metaproamming

It was a great learning experience; I feel a bit confident but there’s a long way to go!
