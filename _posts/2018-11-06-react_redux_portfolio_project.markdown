Finally I am on my last project. I am feeling a bit of relief that I am almost on the verge of completing my program. 
There were myriad of challeges I faced with this project mostly it was to do with the terminology i.e state, props etc.
Once you get hang of state, props store etc. life seems to get better. It is very important to get hang of all these terminoligies early on. Google search is also pretty good to get answer of some of the esoteric questions that you are stuck with. Yet another site which usually is developers life savior is stackoverflow here you usually find pretty comprehensive answers with examples.

My final project is using Rails Api to persit data and React / Redux front end. The app basically allows user to search movies from the movieDB site. It displays row of movies that meet the users search criteria. User can write comment about a movie and data is saved in database. It has the capability to display all comments, dispaly single comment or delete / destroy a comment. React router was used for setting up the routes in app file.
