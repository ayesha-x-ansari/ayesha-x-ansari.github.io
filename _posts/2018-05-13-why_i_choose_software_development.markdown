Coding is not new to me, I have been coding for many years. I just love the thrill and excitement that you feel when a part of a code works, and enjoy it even more when the code is product-ionized. I can spend hours coding and debugging, and will not budge until I make it fully function. I also enjoy web designing and learned HTML many years ago, however I never got the opportunity to bring this knowledge to any use as I ended up being a mainframe programmer. Lately I have taken a few courses such as Unix and Solaris, however they did not align with the areas of programming I enjoy such as web development. 

I was searching online for a coding Bootcamp and came across quite a few through my research. There were a couple that caught my interest, but in the end I decided to join Flatiron as it met my requirements.
I feel I have made a good decision so far as I have enjoyed every minute of the program, but do find the work life balance part of it to be a bit challenging. My recommendation to others is also  follow their passion as it is never too late
